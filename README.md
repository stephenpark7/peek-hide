# Peek-Hide

Hide, show, or toggle the visibility of excluded files.

This extension is based on the source code from [Peek-Hidden-Files](https://github.com/AdrianWilczynski/PeekHiddenFiles) and [vs-make-hidden](https://github.com/Devine-Davies/vs-make-hidden).

## Why?

The `vs-make-hidden` extension does not support multiple workspaces, and `Peek-Hidden-Files` lacks an `Add File to Excluded` feature. Additionally, both repositories have not been updated in quite some time. This extension combines the best features of both, with added enhancements.

## Features

- `Hide Excluded Files`, `Show Excluded Files`, and `Toggle Excluded Files` available through the Command Palette.
- `Add File to Excluded` and `Toggle Excluded Files` available in the Explorer's context menu.

## Known Limitations

- `Add File to Excluded` does not work through the Command Palette; it must be used from the Explorer's context menu.

## What's Next?

- Add a view pane to show hidden files
- Add functionality to remove items from the excluded list
